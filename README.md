# Lab2
This repository contains the lab 2 for the course "Fundamentals of Computer Vision with Deep Learning".

In this lab we will go through some famous CV algorithm for feature extraction, like SIFT, HOG and LBP

In order to do the lab, go to the file "Lab_2_Feature_Extraction.ipynb" in this github repository and click on the "Open in Colab" bar to execute all the code in Google Colab.

If you want to execute this code in your own computer instead of in Google Colab, we recommend to install Anaconda (both for this lab and for the following ones) and install the packages needed for this lab. Matplotlib, Numpy, OpenCV, scikit-image and Jupyter Notebook.

In order to submit the answers from the lab, go to "runtime" -> "restart and run all", download the jupyter notebook by going to File -> download -> download .ipynb and submit the file to blackboard
